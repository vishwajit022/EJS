    <h1>Display Items</h1>
    <P>Here we are going to use a logic if the current second timer is odd then it won't show/display us anything</P>
    <p>But if it is even then it can show us the items</p>
    <p> Dependencies which were imported : EJS express using node i ejs express </p>
    <p> We also need to ensure that we are store all the files in view folder so the express could access the file the way it's programmed to execute </p>
